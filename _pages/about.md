## Hobbies & Interests

I partake in the very basic activities of travelling and taking pictures. From a recent Japan and Taiwan trip:

{::nomarkdown} 
<div class="projects">
  <div class="grid no-gutters">
    <div class="unit one-third">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/garden.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="unit one-third">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/city.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="unit one-third">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/food.jpg">
    </div>
  </div><!-- grid -->

From left to right: Shinjuku National Gyoen, the view from Roppongi Hills, and Wagyu yakiniku. I enjoy eating and cooking - I've been cooking since I was 12.

I spend a lot of my free time playing games (mostly Overwatch nowadays).

## Work

I'm currently a Software Engineer at Airbnb.

Before that, I worked at Google and Crunchyroll a summer each, as a Software Engineer Intern.

Ever since sophomore year of university, I've been on the teaching staff of either CS61B (Data Structures) or CS170 (Algorithms) at Berkeley; first as a reader, then as a TA, then finally as the instructor of CS61BL over the summer of 2016. Throuughout university, my main interests have been vision, graphics, and geometry (partly due to course availability). I also enjoy work in ML and systems, though my exposure there is lower.

My favorite class at Berkeley is [CS274](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/274/), Computational Geometry, with Jonathan Shewchuk.

For two years I was an [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/) Computing Services Committee Officer, and did a large amount of sysadmin and web development work.
