  I modified the example file to render only a square, 0.03f by 0.03f, with random colors at all four colors (colors change every second since the rand function is seeded with the time). The square follows the cursor movement while a mouse button is depressed. </br>

  Further features added include some 3D perspective, camera motion using arroy keys, manual color changing in response to keyboard input, and ability to place spheres at the camera location.
