desc: A brief description of the tools and frameworks used in the making of this website.

## Framework

This site is hosted on Github pages.

The generation is done using Jekyll, which is far better than writing straight HTML.

## Tools

Google Fonts serves the fonts, Raleway and Asul.

Paletton was used for the color scheme.

## Credits

Credit to clenemt, for creating the [jackal jekyll template](https://github.com/clenemt/jackal), which I found on a list of Jekyll templates, and which provides the base CSS and layout.
